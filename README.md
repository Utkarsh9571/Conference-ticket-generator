### What I learned

Well to be honest this challenge caught me off-gaurd. i did not expect this projet to be that complicated. 
  - i haven't worked with files input before, but didn't knew it will be a pain in ass to modify it and work with it.
  - neither i applied background-image in a react app, let alone 5 images, on top of each other, i haven't done it at all, that's a whole new experience, one image is still not applied,
    i don't know why, but its not applying. i'm gonna ask the community for it.

I changed its appearance myself, the gemini's way is too complicated and seems un-necessary just to change its appearance, i did my way, then using uploaded images is also new to me, in this wave of new things i forgot how to show error message and confirmation page on sucessful form complition, but that came in mind later. 

Overall this was fun to some degree.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
